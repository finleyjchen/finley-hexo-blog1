### Why is SEO so important?

Think about the last time you searched something on Google (or other search engines like Bing or Yahoo).  Millions of people are making searches everyday. For online based businesses, SEO is their main marketing focus. For other small, locally based businesses, SEO is important for reaching out to new customers.

I am going to be talking about Google's search engine specifically, as the world's leading search engine. According to [Net Market Share](https://www.netmarketshare.com/search-engine-market-share.aspx?qprid=4&qpcustomd=0), in 2017 Google's search engine averaged a net share of 74.54% of the global marketing share percentage of search engine use. 

### So how do Google's algorithms work?

In short, Google's advanced indexing algorithms use web crawlers to scan websites and rank them in relevant search phrases. For example, if your website is a coffee shop, Google's web crawlers will search the content on your website and rank it under keywords most related, like "coffee shop san diego". Google's web crawlers are indexing the internet _all _the time.

So how does Google rank certain coffee shops over others?

### Content is king

Microsoft founder Bill Gates once said, "content is king". Google is constantly updating and changing the way they rank websites, so there's no way to cheat Google's web crawling algorithms to get that #1 spot on search rankings. Rather, the best way to rank higher on Google is to follow Google's [own advice](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451184?hl=en) and provide quality content!

Those who succeed will propel the Internet forward as a marketplace of ideas, experiences, and products - a marketplace of content.

Okay, so make quality content. What does this actually mean?

Many people have done research to find out what Google really seeks in 'quality content', but Patrick Stox wrote a good [article on Search Engine Land ](https://searchengineland.com/what-is-quality-content-251071)to help identify what good content means. 

### Best practices

The idea of following 'best practices' is what is accepted as the best and easiest way to improve your website's rankings.

So back to our hypothetical coffee shop website. As a small business with not too much content, so how are we going to match up against other coffee shops? 

By making sure your website follows SEO best practices, following all the guidelines for a 'high quality website'. 

Search engine optimization consists of many small changes made to make it easier for web crawlers to identify quality content. This is where the role of SEO specialists comes in. Your website's infrastructure contains a lot more than just the words and pictures you see on the screen. For example, a websites page loading speed, which is determined by tons of factors from hosting to compressing images, can be optimized, and may result in better search rankings. Maintaining semantic html to give meaning to your content will also help. 

Website accessibility has also become an increasing concern for SEO best practices. Having a website that is mobile-friendly makes a huge difference in SEO since 2015. 

SEO specialists follow many of Google's self-outlined best practices. I will be writing more on these best practices, but here's a short list of readings to better understand more about SEO and best practices.
