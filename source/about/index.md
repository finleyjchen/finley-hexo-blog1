Hi, my name is Finley Chen. I'm an 18 year old web developer and student at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. I am using this blog as a record of some of my projects, serving as a reference as well as an outlet for some of my random thoughts. 

I'm also a freelancer. Looking to have me work on your next project? Learn more about my services or contact me at my main website, [fjchen.net](fjchen.net).
